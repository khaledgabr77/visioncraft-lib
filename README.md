# Create Your Own Vision Library

This repository provides step-by-step instructions to help you build a custom image processing and computer vision library, primarily from scratch. Dive in and start creating!.

## Introduction

This repository is a guide to help you build your own image processing and computer vision library. The library will be built from scratch, using only the c++ programming language and its libraries. The goal is to help you understand the underlying concepts and algorithms that power image processing and computer vision applications.

### Instructions

clone the repository and follow the instructions below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/khaledgabr77/visioncraft-lib.git
```

build the library.

inside visioncraft-lib directory, create a `build` directory and run `cmake`.

```bash
cd visioncraft-lib
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
